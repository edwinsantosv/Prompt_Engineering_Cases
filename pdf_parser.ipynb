Waly Chrobrego 1-2, 70-\\n500 Szczecin, Poland \\nAbstract.  3D printing technology was developed nearly 30 years ago. One of its characteristics \\nis that instead of removing materials, 3D printing creates 3D elements directly from CAD models, adding one layer of material on another. This offers a beneficial capability of making \\ncomplex elements in terms of shape and materials, impossible to be manufactured by \\ntraditional methods. Owing to intensive research in recent years, considerable progress has \\nbeen achieved in the development and commercialisation of new innovative processes of 3D \\nprinting by fused deposition modeling (FDM), including printing of composite materials. The \\nstudy outlines the main methods of creating polymer composite structures using FDM technology. \\n1 Introduction \\nThe idea of 3D printing has been known for decades [1]. Additive manufacturing is today used for \\nmaking tools and rapid prototypes at the design and construction stage in aviation, automobile and \\nmilitary industries, architecture, medicine, goldsmit hing, food and footwear industries, where in a \\nrelatively short time a real model can be made to be presented, apart from printed documentation, to a \\ncustomer or sponsor. The development of 3D pr inting technology has enabled making prototypes as \\nwell as spare parts or complete devices with attractive properties, usually of small size. 3D printers in \\nmedicine are used for printing prosthetics, implants, and bioprints using cells (wound healing) [1-5]. \\nExtended applicability and wider dissemination of 3D printing, as well as higher performance \\nrequirements necessitate seeking multimaterial solutions and use of state-of-the-art composites [2-9]. \\nComposite properties depend on many factors, i.e. properties of component phases, their relative \\nquantities and geometry (particle size,  shape, orientation and distribution of the reinforcement phase \\nin the matrix) as well as the strength of inter facial boundaries or production methods [10]. \\nThis study reviews the state of the ar t in FDM printing of composite materials. \\n                                                 \\na Corresponding author : k.bryll@am.szczecin.pl \\n   © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.
